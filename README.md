it also needs to go over all the details that you and I have gone over in this chat session, detailing everything about the neurons, Input Layers, sensory encoding, local connectivity, hidden layers, hierarchical processing recurrent connections, lateral connections, dropout, output layers, modulatory systems, training algorithsm, backpropagation, regularization, l1/l2 regularization, noise injection, learning rate scheduling, alternative learning rules, hebbian learning, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), optimization algorithms, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), momentum, RMSprop, Adam, transfer learning, curriculum learning and meta learning. 

we need to let the community researchers/developers know what classes and models and everything will be utilized, and again we want to include any file structure, so you and I can also stay on track.

## Contribution

NeuraLearn is an open-source initiative, and contributions are highly welcomed! Check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## Roadmap

### Short-Term:
- Finalize the basic neuron and network models.
- Set up data pipelines for sensory inputs.
- Implement initial training loops and evaluation metrics.

### Mid-Term:
- Integrate more advanced learning mechanisms.
- Explore neuromodulatory systems for attention and memory.
- Begin large-scale training and evaluation on benchmark datasets.

### Long-Term:
- Incorporate feedback from the community to refine models and architectures.
- Explore potential real-world applications.
- Collaborate with neuroscientists to ensure biological accuracy and relevance.
