## Introduction

Traditional neural networks, while powerful, often lack the nuance and complexity of biological neural systems. NeuraLearn is an ambitious project that aims to incorporate more biologically-realistic mechanisms into artificial neural networks, paving the way for more advanced and nuanced AI systems.

## Architecture

### Neurons

#### Membrane Potential

The **membrane potential** (`V_m`) represents the voltage difference across the neuron's cell membrane. It's the primary variable that determines whether a neuron will fire or not.

- **Resting Potential**: Typically around -70 mV. This is the baseline potential of the neuron when it's not being stimulated.
- **Depolarization**: An increase in the membrane potential, making it less negative.
- **Hyperpolarization**: A decrease in the membrane potential, making it more negative.

#### Firing Threshold

The **firing threshold** is the value of the membrane potential at which the neuron fires an action potential (or spike). When the membrane potential reaches this value, the neuron produces a spike and sends a signal down its axon.

- Typical value: Around -55 mV, but this can vary among neuron types and species.
- The threshold ensures that the neuron only fires when a sufficiently strong input is received.

#### Refractory Period

After a neuron fires an action potential, there's a period during which it's either impossible or difficult for the neuron to fire again. This is known as the **refractory period**.

- **Absolute Refractory Period**: A period immediately after an action potential during which it's impossible for the neuron to fire again, regardless of the strength of incoming signals. Typically lasts about 1-2 ms.
- **Relative Refractory Period**: Follows the absolute refractory period. During this time, it's possible for the neuron to fire again, but it requires a stronger-than-normal stimulus. This period can last several milliseconds.

#### (Optional) Ion Channels and Dynamics

Ion channels are protein structures in the neuron's cell membrane that allow specific ions to flow in and out of the cell. The flow of ions through these channels is what generates the neuron's electrical properties.

- **Sodium (Na+) Channels**: When these channels open, sodium ions flow into the neuron, causing depolarization.
- **Potassium (K+) Channels**: When these channels open, potassium ions flow out of the neuron, causing repolarization or hyperpolarization.
- **Calcium (Ca2+) Channels**: These play various roles, including in the release of neurotransmitters at synapses.
- **Ion Pumps**: These actively transport ions against their concentration gradients to maintain the resting potential. The sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+ pump) is a primary example.

The **Hodgkin-Huxley model** is a set of differential equations that describe how the action potential in neurons is initiated and propagated. It's based on the dynamics of these ion channels and is used to simulate the behavior of neurons in detail.

### Input Layer

- **Sensory Encoding**: Convert raw sensory data (e.g., pixel values) into a format suitable for processing.
- **Local Connectivity**: Neurons have local receptive fields, simulating how certain cells respond to specific parts of the sensory field.

### Hidden Layers

- **Hierarchical Processing**: Multiple layers process data in increasing levels of abstraction.
- **Recurrent Connections**: Neurons have recurrent connections for temporal dynamics and feedback loops.
- **Lateral Connections**: Neurons connect to their neighbors within the same layer, simulating lateral inhibition.
- **Dropout**: Introduce dropout layers for redundancy and robustness.

### Output Layer

Depending on the task, this could be a softmax layer for classification, a linear layer for regression, or something more specialized.

### Modulatory Systems

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Mechanisms that allow the network to focus on specific parts of the input.
- **Memory Systems**: Components that store and retrieve information over longer timescales.

## Training Algorithms

- **Backpropagation**: The primary algorithm for adjusting weights based on error.
- **Regularization**: Techniques like L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Noise Injection**: Introduce noise during training for robustness.
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adjust the learning rate during training.
- **Alternative Learning Rules**: Explore biologically plausible rules like Hebbian learning and STDP.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Techniques like SGD, Momentum, RMSprop, and Adam to adjust weights.
- **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained models and fine-tune them for specific tasks.
- **Curriculum Learning**: Introduce training examples in a specific order.
- **Meta Learning**: Train models to learn how to learn.
