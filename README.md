## Features

- **Amygdala Simulation**: Replicates the fear-response mechanism seen in biological systems.
- **Hippocampus Memory**: Models short-term and long-term memory functions.
- **Occipital Lobe Processor**: Implements visual processing mechanisms.
- **Temporal Lobe Processor**: Handles auditory and linguistic information.
- **Main TensorFlow Brain**: Central processing unit that integrates outputs from all the components.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuraLearn.git

2. Navigate to the NeuraLearn directory:
cd NeuraLearn

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Architecture

NeuraLearn's architecture is inspired by the biological neural systems found in mammals. Key components include:

- **Amygdala**: Simulates emotional processing, especially fear recognition.
- **Hippocampus**: Handles memory, both short-term and long-term.
- **Occipital Lobe**: Focuses on visual processing and recognition.
- **Temporal Lobe**: Deals with auditory and linguistic processing.

All components interface with the Main TensorFlow Brain, allowing for a seamless integration of diverse neural processes.

## Usage

To run NeuraLearn and witness its capabilities:
python main.py

Detailed documentation on individual component functionalities and how to integrate them into other projects can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/yourusername/NeuraLearn/wiki).
