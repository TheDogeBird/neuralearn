## Introduction

Traditional neural networks, while powerful, often lack the nuance and complexity of biological neural systems. NeuraLearn is an ambitious project that aims to incorporate more biologically-realistic mechanisms into artificial neural networks, paving the way for more advanced and nuanced AI systems.

## Features

- **Biologically-Inspired Neurons**: Neurons that simulate the behavior of their biological counterparts, including spike-based communication, refractory periods, and more.
- **Complex Network Architectures**: Hierarchical structures with local and recurrent connectivity, simulating the organization of neural circuits in the brain.
- **Advanced Learning Mechanisms**: Beyond traditional backpropagation, NeuraLearn explores biologically plausible learning rules like spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).
- **Modularity**: Different neural modules for specialized tasks, mimicking the specialized regions of the brain.
- **Sensory Integration**: Ability to process and learn from sensory data, such as vision and auditory inputs.

## Installation

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/NeuraLearn.git
cd NeuraLearn
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be provided as the project develops. For now:

\```bash
python main.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
\```
