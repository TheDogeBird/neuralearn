## Introduction

Traditional neural networks, while powerful, often lack the nuance and complexity of biological neural systems. NeuraLearn is an ambitious project that aims to incorporate more biologically-realistic mechanisms into artificial neural networks, paving the way for more advanced and nuanced AI systems.

## Architecture

### Neurons

NeuraLearn's neurons are designed to simulate their biological counterparts. They incorporate:
- **Spike-Based Communication**: Neurons communicate via spikes or action potentials.
- **Synaptic Delay**: There's a delay as signals travel across synapses.
- **Refractory Period**: After firing, neurons have a refractory period during which they can't fire again.

### Input Layer

- **Sensory Encoding**: Convert raw sensory data (e.g., pixel values) into a format suitable for processing.
- **Local Connectivity**: Neurons have local receptive fields, simulating how certain cells respond to specific parts of the sensory field.

### Hidden Layers

- **Hierarchical Processing**: Multiple layers process data in increasing levels of abstraction.
- **Recurrent Connections**: Neurons have recurrent connections for temporal dynamics and feedback loops.
- **Lateral Connections**: Neurons connect to their neighbors within the same layer, simulating lateral inhibition.
- **Dropout**: Introduce dropout layers for redundancy and robustness.

### Output Layer

Depending on the task, this could be a softmax layer for classification, a linear layer for regression, or something more specialized.

### Modulatory Systems

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Mechanisms that allow the network to focus on specific parts of the input.
- **Memory Systems**: Components that store and retrieve information over longer periods.

## Training Algorithms

- **Backpropagation**: The standard training algorithm for neural networks.
- **Regularization**:
  - **L1/L2 Regularization**: Penalize large weights to prevent overfitting.
  - **Noise Injection**: Add noise to the inputs or weights during training.
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Start with a larger learning rate and reduce it over time.
- **Alternative Learning Rules**:
  - **Hebbian Learning**: A biologically-inspired rule.
  - **Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**: A biologically plausible learning rule.
- **Optimization Algorithms**:
  - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
  - **Momentum**
  - **RMSprop**
  - **Adam**
- **Transfer Learning**: Start with a pre-trained network and fine-tune it.
- **Curriculum Learning**: Start training on simpler tasks or data and gradually increase the complexity.
- **Meta-Learning**: Train the network to learn how to learn.
