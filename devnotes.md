## Neuron Model

### Membrane Potential

The **membrane potential** (`V_m`) represents the voltage difference across the neuron's cell membrane. It's the primary variable that determines whether a neuron will fire or not.

- **Resting Potential**: Typically around -70 mV. This is the baseline potential of the neuron when it's not being stimulated.
- **Depolarization**: An increase in the membrane potential, making it less negative.
- **Hyperpolarization**: A decrease in the membrane potential, making it more negative.

### Firing Threshold

The **firing threshold** is the value of the membrane potential at which the neuron fires an action potential (or spike). When the membrane potential reaches this value, the neuron produces a spike and sends a signal down its axon.

- Typical value: Around -55 mV, but this can vary among neuron types and species.
- The threshold ensures that the neuron only fires when a sufficiently strong input is received.

### Refractory Period

After a neuron fires an action potential, there's a period during which it's either impossible or difficult for the neuron to fire again. This is known as the **refractory period**.

- **Absolute Refractory Period**: A period immediately after an action potential during which it's impossible for the neuron to fire again, regardless of the strength of incoming signals. Typically lasts about 1-2 ms.
- **Relative Refractory Period**: Follows the absolute refractory period. During this time, it's possible for the neuron to fire again, but it requires a stronger-than-normal stimulus. This period can last several milliseconds.

### (Optional) Ion Channels and Dynamics

Ion channels are protein structures in the neuron's cell membrane that allow specific ions to flow in and out of the cell. The flow of ions through these channels is what generates the neuron's electrical properties.

- **Sodium (Na+) Channels**: When these channels open, sodium ions flow into the neuron, causing depolarization.
- **Potassium (K+) Channels**: When these channels open, potassium ions flow out of the neuron, causing repolarization or hyperpolarization.
- **Calcium (Ca2+) Channels**: These play various roles, including in the release of neurotransmitters at synapses.
- **Ion Pumps**: These actively transport ions against their concentration gradients to maintain the resting potential. The sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+ pump) is a primary example.

The **Hodgkin-Huxley model** is a set of differential equations that describe how the action potential in neurons is initiated and propagated. It's based on the dynamics of these ion channels and is used to simulate the behavior of neurons in detail.
