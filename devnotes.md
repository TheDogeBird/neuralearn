## Neuron Model

### 1. Membrane Potential

The **membrane potential** (`V_m`) is the voltage difference across the neuron's cell membrane. It fluctuates based on the inputs the neuron receives and determines whether the neuron will fire an action potential.

#### Code:
```python
import numpy as np

class Neuron:
    def __init__(self):
        self.V_m = -70  # Initial membrane potential in mV (resting potential)
        self.resting_potential = -70  # Resting potential in mV
        self.capacitance = 1.0  # Capacitance of the neuronal membrane
```

### 2. Firing Threshold

The **firing threshold** is the membrane potential value at which the neuron fires an action potential. When `V_m` reaches this value, the neuron produces a spike.

#### Code:
```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.V_m = -70  # Membrane potential in mV
        self.threshold = -55  # Firing threshold in mV
```

### 3. Refractory Period

After firing, there's a period during which the neuron cannot fire again, ensuring signal clarity and directionality.

#### Code:
```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.V_m = -70  # Membrane potential in mV
        self.threshold = -55  # Firing threshold in mV
        self.refractory_period = 2  # Refractory period in ms
        self.last_spike_time = None  # Time of the last spike
```

### 4. Ion Channels and Dynamics (Optional)

Ion channels control the flow of ions across the neuron's membrane, influencing the membrane potential.

#### Code:
```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.Na_concentration = 50  # Sodium ion concentration
        self.K_concentration = 20   # Potassium ion concentration
        self.Ca_concentration = 0.05  # Calcium ion concentration
        self.ion_channels = {"Na": True, "K": True, "Ca": False}  # Active ion channels
```


### 5. Receiving Inputs

Neurons receive inputs through synapses, which are connections from other neurons. Each synapse has a weight, which determines the strength of the connection. Additionally, synapses can be excitatory (increasing the membrane potential) or inhibitory (decreasing the membrane potential). We'll also consider a time delay for the propagation of the spike from one neuron to another.

#### Code:
\```python
class Neuron:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... (previous initialization code)
        self.synaptic_inputs = []  # List to store incoming synaptic activities

    class Synapse:
        def __init__(self, pre_neuron, weight, delay, neurotransmitter_type):
            self.pre_neuron = pre_neuron  # Neuron sending the spike
            self.weight = weight  # Strength of the connection
            self.delay = delay  # Time delay for spike propagation
            self.neurotransmitter_type = neurotransmitter_type  # 'excitatory' or 'inhibitory'

        def propagate_spike(self, spike_time):
            """Calculate the effect of an incoming spike."""
            if self.neurotransmitter_type == 'excitatory':
                effect = self.weight
            else:
                effect = -self.weight
            return spike_time + self.delay, effect

    def receive_spike(self, synapse, spike_time):
        """Handle incoming spikes through synapses."""
        new_spike_time, effect = synapse.propagate_spike(spike_time)
        self.synaptic_inputs.append((new_spike_time, effect))
        # In a real-time simulation, you'd adjust V_m based on the effect at the appropriate time
\```

In this model, each neuron can have multiple synapses. When a spike is received, its effect on the post-synaptic neuron's membrane potential (`V_m`) is determined by the synapse's weight and neurotransmitter type. The spike also has a time delay associated with it, representing the time it takes for the spike to propagate from the pre-synaptic neuron to the post-synaptic neuron.

(Note: In the actual markdown, you'd remove the backslashes before the triple backticks. They are included here to prevent the code blocks from being executed in this format.)
