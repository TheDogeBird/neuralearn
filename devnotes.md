## Neuron Model

---

### 1. Membrane Potential

The **membrane potential** (`V_m`) is the voltage difference across the neuron's cell membrane. It fluctuates based on the inputs the neuron receives and determines whether the neuron will fire an action potential.

### 2. Firing Threshold

The **firing threshold** is the membrane potential value at which the neuron fires an action potential. When `V_m` reaches this value, the neuron produces a spike.

### 3. Refractory Period

After firing, there's a period during which the neuron cannot fire again, ensuring signal clarity and directionality.

#### Full Code:
```python
import numpy as np

class Neuron:
    def __init__(self):
        self.V_m = -70  # Initial membrane potential in mV (resting potential)
        self.resting_potential = -70  # Resting potential in mV
        self.capacitance = 1.0  # Capacitance of the neuronal membrane
        self.threshold = -55  # Firing threshold in mV
        self.refractory_period = 2  # Refractory period in ms
        self.last_spike_time = None  # Time of the last spike
        self.synaptic_inputs = []  # List to store incoming synaptic activities

    class Synapse:
        def __init__(self, pre_neuron, weight, delay, neurotransmitter_type):
            self.pre_neuron = pre_neuron  # Neuron sending the spike
            self.weight = weight  # Strength of the connection
            self.delay = delay  # Time delay for spike propagation
            self.neurotransmitter_type = neurotransmitter_type  # 'excitatory' or 'inhibitory'

        def propagate_spike(self, spike_time):
            """Calculate the effect of an incoming spike."""
            if self.neurotransmitter_type == 'excitatory':
                effect = self.weight
            else:
                effect = -self.weight
            return spike_time + self.delay, effect

    def receive_spike(self, synapse, spike_time):
        """Handle incoming spikes through synapses."""
        new_spike_time, effect = synapse.propagate_spike(spike_time)
        self.synaptic_inputs.append((new_spike_time, effect))

    def integrate_inputs(self, current_time):
        """Integrate inputs over time and adjust the membrane potential."""
        total_effect = 0
        new_inputs = []
        for spike_time, effect in self.synaptic_inputs:
            if spike_time <= current_time:
                total_effect += effect
            else:
                new_inputs.append((spike_time, effect))
        self.synaptic_inputs = new_inputs
        self.V_m += total_effect

    def check_firing(self, current_time):
        """Check if the neuron should fire based on the membrane potential and refractory period."""
        if (self.V_m >= self.threshold) and (current_time - self.last_spike_time > self.refractory_period):
            self.fire_action_potential(current_time)
            return True
        return False

    def fire_action_potential(self, current_time):
        """Fire an action potential and reset the membrane potential."""
        self.V_m = self.resting_potential
        self.last_spike_time = current_time
        # Here, you'd also propagate the spike to connected neurons
```



### 4. Ion Channels and Dynamics (Optional)

Ion channels control the flow of ions across the neuron's membrane, influencing the membrane potential.

#### Code:
```python
    def __init__(self):
        self.Na_concentration = 50  # Sodium ion concentration
        self.K_concentration = 20   # Potassium ion concentration
        self.Ca_concentration = 0.05  # Calcium ion concentration
        self.ion_channels = {"Na": True, "K": True, "Ca": False}  # Active ion channels
```


### 5. Receiving Inputs

Neurons receive inputs through synapses, which are connections from other neurons. Each synapse has a weight, which determines the strength of the connection. Additionally, synapses can be excitatory (increasing the membrane potential) or inhibitory (decreasing the membrane potential). We'll also consider a time delay for the propagation of the spike from one neuron to another.

#### Code:
```python
class Neuron:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... (previous initialization code)
        self.synaptic_inputs = []  # List to store incoming synaptic activities

    class Synapse:
        def __init__(self, pre_neuron, weight, delay, neurotransmitter_type):
            self.pre_neuron = pre_neuron  # Neuron sending the spike
            self.weight = weight  # Strength of the connection
            self.delay = delay  # Time delay for spike propagation
            self.neurotransmitter_type = neurotransmitter_type  # 'excitatory' or 'inhibitory'

        def propagate_spike(self, spike_time):
            """Calculate the effect of an incoming spike."""
            if self.neurotransmitter_type == 'excitatory':
                effect = self.weight
            else:
                effect = -self.weight
            return spike_time + self.delay, effect

    def receive_spike(self, synapse, spike_time):
        """Handle incoming spikes through synapses."""
        new_spike_time, effect = synapse.propagate_spike(spike_time)
        self.synaptic_inputs.append((new_spike_time, effect))
        # In a real-time simulation, you'd adjust V_m based on the effect at the appropriate time
```

In this model, each neuron can have multiple synapses. When a spike is received, its effect on the post-synaptic neuron's membrane potential (`V_m`) is determined by the synapse's weight and neurotransmitter type. The spike also has a time delay associated with it, representing the time it takes for the spike to propagate from the pre-synaptic neuron to the post-synaptic neuron.

### 6. Processing Inputs and Firing

Once a neuron receives inputs, it needs to process them and determine if the accumulated input is sufficient to cause the neuron to fire an action potential. This involves integrating the inputs over time, checking against the firing threshold, and considering the refractory period.

#### Code:
```python
class Neuron:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... (previous initialization code)
        self.last_fired_time = -np.inf  # Time the neuron last fired

    def integrate_inputs(self, current_time):
        """Integrate inputs over time and adjust the membrane potential."""
        total_effect = 0
        new_inputs = []
        for spike_time, effect in self.synaptic_inputs:
            if spike_time <= current_time:
                total_effect += effect
            else:
                new_inputs.append((spike_time, effect))
        self.synaptic_inputs = new_inputs
        self.V_m += total_effect

    def check_firing(self, current_time):
        """Check if the neuron should fire based on the membrane potential and refractory period."""
        if (self.V_m >= self.threshold) and (current_time - self.last_fired_time > self.refractory_period):
            self.fire_action_potential(current_time)
            return True
        return False

    def fire_action_potential(self, current_time):
        """Fire an action potential and reset the membrane potential."""
        self.V_m = self.resting_potential
        self.last_fired_time = current_time
        # Here, you'd also propagate the spike to connected neurons
```

In this model, the `integrate_inputs` method processes the inputs that have arrived up to the current time, adjusting the membrane potential (`V_m`) accordingly. The `check_firing` method then checks if the neuron should fire based on the current membrane potential and the time since the neuron last fired (to account for the refractory period). If the neuron fires, the `fire_action_potential` method resets the membrane potential and records the firing time.



### 7. Resetting the Neuron After Firing

After a neuron fires an action potential, it's crucial to reset certain properties to ensure the neuron can process subsequent inputs correctly. This reset process often involves returning the membrane potential to its resting state and updating the time of the last spike. Additionally, in more complex models, other properties like ion concentrations might be reset.

#### Code for Resetting:
```python
    def reset_after_firing(self):
        """Reset the neuron's properties after firing."""
        self.V_m = self.resting_potential
        # Additional reset logic can be added here if needed
```

By invoking this method after the neuron fires, we ensure that it's ready to process new inputs and fire again when the conditions are met.

## Synaptic Weights and Their Initializations

In neural networks, synaptic weights represent the strength or amplitude of a connection between two neurons. The value of these weights determines the magnitude of the influence one neuron has on another. Proper initialization of these weights is crucial for the convergence and performance of the network.

There are several methods for weight initialization, and the choice often depends on the type of activation function used in the neurons. Some common initialization methods include:

1. **Zero Initialization**: Setting all weights to zero. This is generally not recommended as it leads to the problem where every neuron in the network behaves the same way, making learning impossible.
2. **Random Initialization**: Weights are initialized with small random numbers. This breaks the symmetry but can sometimes lead to slow convergence.
3. **Xavier/Glorot Initialization**: Suitable for the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation functions. The weights are initialized with values drawn from a distribution with zero mean and a specific variance.
4. **He Initialization**: Designed for ReLU activation functions. The weights are initialized with values drawn from a distribution with zero mean and a variance of 2/n, where n is the number of input units.

#### Code:

```python
import numpy as np

class Synapse:
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, initialization="xavier"):
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.output_size = output_size
        self.initialization = initialization
        self.weights = self.initialize_weights()

    def initialize_weights(self):
        if self.initialization == "zero":
            return np.zeros((self.input_size, self.output_size))
        elif self.initialization == "random":
            return np.random.randn(self.input_size, self.output_size) * 0.01
        elif self.initialization == "xavier":
            return np.random.randn(self.input_size, self.output_size) / np.sqrt(self.input_size)
        elif self.initialization == "he":
            return np.random.randn(self.input_size, self.output_size) * np.sqrt(2. / self.input_size)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown initialization method: {self.initialization}")
```


## Implement Synaptic Delay

Synaptic delay is the time taken for a signal (or spike) to travel from the presynaptic neuron to the postsynaptic neuron across a synapse. This delay is crucial in simulating more realistic neuron interactions and can affect the timing and synchronization of neural activities.

In biological systems, synaptic delays can range from 1ms to tens of milliseconds, depending on various factors like the type of synapse, distance between neurons, and the type of neurotransmitter.

To implement synaptic delay in our model, we can use a queue or buffer mechanism. When a spike is generated by the presynaptic neuron, it's placed in a buffer, and only after the delay duration has passed, the spike is delivered to the postsynaptic neuron.

#### Code:

```python
from collections import deque

class Synapse:
    def __init__(self, delay=5):
        self.delay = delay  # Synaptic delay in ms
        self.spike_buffer = deque(maxlen=delay)

    def transmit_spike(self, spike):
        # Add spike to the buffer
        self.spike_buffer.append(spike)
        
        # If buffer is full, return the oldest spike (FIFO)
        if len(self.spike_buffer) == self.delay:
            return self.spike_buffer.popleft()
        else:
            return None
```


## Implement Plasticity Mechanisms

Neural plasticity refers to the ability of the neural network to change its connections and behavior over time based on experience. One of the most well-known plasticity mechanisms is Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP).

### Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)

STDP is a biological learning rule based on the relative timing of spikes between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The basic idea is:
- If the presynaptic neuron fires before the postsynaptic neuron (causal), the synapse is strengthened.
- If the postsynaptic neuron fires before the presynaptic neuron (anti-causal), the synapse is weakened.

#### Code:

```python
class Synapse:
    def __init__(self, weight=0.5, max_weight=1.0, min_weight=0.0, stdp_window=20):
        self.weight = weight
        self.max_weight = max_weight
        self.min_weight = min_weight
        self.stdp_window = stdp_window  # Time window for STDP in ms

    def apply_stdp(self, pre_spike_time, post_spike_time):
        delta_t = post_spike_time - pre_spike_time

        # Causal spike pair
        if delta_t > 0:
            self.weight += self.stdp_function(delta_t)
        # Anti-causal spike pair
        else:
            self.weight -= self.stdp_function(-delta_t)

        # Ensure weights remain within bounds
        self.weight = max(min(self.weight, self.max_weight), self.min_weight)

    def stdp_function(self, delta_t):
        # Example exponential STDP function
        return np.exp(-delta_t / self.stdp_window)
```

In the above code, the `apply_stdp` method adjusts the synaptic weight based on the relative spike timings. The `stdp_function` provides an example exponential decay based on the time difference, but other STDP functions can be used.

(Note: More advanced STDP models can incorporate factors like neuromodulation, frequency dependence, and more.)

### (Optional) Other Biologically Plausible Plasticity Rules

There are many other plasticity rules observed in biological systems, such as homeostatic plasticity, metaplasticity, and more. Implementing these would require a deeper dive into the specific mechanisms and their computational models.
